Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American journalist, novelist, short-story writer, and sportsman. His economical and understated style—which he termed the iceberg theory—had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous lifestyle and his public image brought him admiration from later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two non-fiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story collections, and three non-fiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.

Many people in the game are not aware of this magic, besides the aforementioned adepts who try to keep it secret. Alchemy is comprised of four different elements; water, fire, wind and earth and adepts specialize in a certain element.

Seven years after this event, the ship had shown up near Pluto's orbit and a team was sent out to investigate and recover the ship along with William Weir who was the original architect of the ship.

But his pride and the fact that the Event Horizon gives him hallucinations of his deceased wife as though she were real causes him to start descending into madness giving into what the ship is doing to him and results in Weir killing off members of the rescue team and allowing the remnants of hell to take over him.
